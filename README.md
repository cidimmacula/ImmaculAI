# ImmaculAI Homunculus AI
This is a Homunculus AI based off the Homunculus AI by DrAzzy. It is duplicated from: https://github.com/Kisaro/AzzyAI; while the original can be found at: https://github.com/SpenceKonde/AzzyAI

For more information on the original AzzyAI, see the official website: http://drazzy.com/ro/ai
 
## Disclaimer ##
This AI is going to be edited and developed more of a hobby than a maintenance of the AzzyAI config. It will be developed using Nova Ragnarok and thus may or may not work with your preferred server of the game, official or otherwise.

## Features

- Group Tactics
   - Configurable by using H_GroupTactics.lua
   - Allows people to set MonsterIds to a single tactic group
   - Configurator UI not yet updated for this feature
- Full Level 10 Skill configurations for all Homunculi
- Option to not use Vanilmirth's Caprice (this is due to its 2000ms global cooldown in Nova that is preventing other skills from being casted)
