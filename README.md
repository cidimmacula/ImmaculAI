# ImmaculAI Homunculus AI
This is not the official AzzyAI but a duplicate of a fork from: https://github.com/Kisaro/AzzyAI.
For the original repository please refere to: https://github.com/SpenceKonde/AzzyAI

For more information, see the official website: http://drazzy.com/ro/ai

## Install ##
 - Download the [current version](https://github.com/Kisaro/AzzyAI/archive/master.zip)
 - Open the downloaded ZIP-file
 - Navigate to your Ragnarok-folder
 - Copy the *USER_AI*-folder from the ZIP-file into the *AI*-folder of your Ragnarok-folder (will overwrite the currently installed user-AI, make backups!)
 - To instantly see changes ingame, *Rest* -> *Call* your Homunculus or use `@refresh` if you have access to server commands
 
## Disclaimer ##
This AI is going to be edited and developed more of a hobby than a maintenance of the AzzyAI config. It will be developed using Nova Ragnarok and thus may or may not work with your preferred server of the game.
